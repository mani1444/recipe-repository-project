## Chicken broth

### Dashi

1. Put Konbu in 1L water for 30 minutes.
1. Put Niboshi and boil with low heat until the water is boiling.
1. Take Konbu off.
1. Removing a scum, keep boiling water for 10 minutes.

### Chicken broth

1. For now, using [POPLA International Torigara Stock Paste](https://www.popla.com/new-products/torigara-stock-paste).

> NOTE: This step will be replaced with a real chicken process in a future version.

## Flavored egg

### Half-boiled egg

1. Put eggs in a refrigerator for a while.
1. Take eggs into boiled water for exactly 7 minutes.
1. Take eggs off and put in cold water.

### Flavoring

1. Mix Dashi soup 20 ml, Shoyu 40 ml, Mirin 40 ml and put in a Ziplock.
1. Put the half-boiled egg in the Ziplock.
1. Put the Ziplock bag in a refrigerator at least for 30 minutes.

> NOTE: **DO NOT** keep eggs in Ziplock with soup longer than a few hours, or these eggs would be too much flavor.

## Sauce

### Shoyu sauce

1. Put Shoyu 100 ml, Mirin 100 ml, Sake 25 ml, Konbu, Niboshi into a pan.
1. Boil it until it has bubbles.
1. Take Konbu and Niboshi off.
1. Put sauce into a bowl.

### Flavored oil

1. Put canola oil, Niboshi, Konbu, Katsuobushi, and chopped white part of green onions into a pan.
1. Fry them until green onions turn to brown.
1. Filter oil with a net into a bowl.

## Chashu

1. Put chopped pork libs 200 g to the pot.
1. Boil it with high heat until water is boiling.

## Greens

1. Boil enough water with small amount of salt in a pot.
1. Put spinach into the pot and boil for 1.5 minutes.
1. Take spinach out and put in cold water.

## Noodles

1. Mix 70 ml cold water with 2g of salt, 20 ml boiled water with 2 g of baking soda.
1. Mix it with bread flour 250 g and make a dough.
1. Cut it and make noodles about 70 cm long.

To run these steps, I was using [Philips HR2371/05 Compact Pasta Maker](https://amzn.to/2CBEhJt). This machine produces relatively thick noodles with out-of-box configuration, which requires for about 4 minutes boiling.

1. Put Shoyu sauce and flavored oil.
1. Put cooked noodles
1. Put a flavored egg.

1. Put a chink of spinach.
1. Taste and fun.
