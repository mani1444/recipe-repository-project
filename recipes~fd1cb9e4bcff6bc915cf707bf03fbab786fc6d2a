## Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup packed light-brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips

## Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). 
2. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and baking soda. Set aside.

## Mixing the Dough

1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter, granulated sugar, light-brown sugar, and salt until the mixture is creamy and smooth.

2. Add the pure vanilla extract and eggs to the mixture, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

3. Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet mixture, mixing until well combined.

4. Stir in the chocolate chips.

## Baking

1. Drop spoonfuls of cookie dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

2. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are golden but the centers are still soft.

3. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.

## Enjoy!

These chocolate chip cookies are best enjoyed fresh out of the oven with a glass of milk. Store any leftovers in an airtight container for later enjoyment.
